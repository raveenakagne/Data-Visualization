## 📅 Timeframe
Data collected from **July 2011 to December 2020**

## 🌐 Dataset Description
This dataset, sourced from the **City of Palo Alto**, captures over nine years of electric vehicle charging activity and interaction. It is central to our network-based analysis aiming to enhance infrastructure planning and identify key usage patterns.

### ⚙️ Key Features Analyzed
- **Start Date & End Date**  
  Reveal peak station usage periods, daily cycles, and seasonal trends  

- **Total Duration**  
  Average charging duration — reflects user habits and station efficiency  

- **Energy (kWh)**  
  Power consumed per session — useful for profiling equipment performance  

- **GHG Savings (kg)** & **Gasoline Savings (gallons)**  
  Measure the environmental impact — vital for sustainability metrics  

- **Port Type & Plug Type**  
  Capture user preferences and detect compatibility gaps  

- **EVSE ID & Address**  
  Essential for geospatial mapping and identifying high-demand or underserved areas  

- **Fee**  
  Charging session cost — helps analyze spending behavior and pricing models  

- **Ended By**  
  Indicates how charging sessions were terminated — informs on user and station behavior  

- **User ID**  
  Allows segmentation between frequent and occasional users  

## 📊 Objectives
- Perform **real-time usage analysis** to uncover behavioral and temporal patterns  
- Apply **network analysis** to map high-density charging clusters and underutilized stations  
- Use **geographical visualizations** to highlight regional trends and infrastructure gaps  
- Quantify **environmental and financial metrics** for sustainability evaluation  

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NetworkX, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Tableau
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub for version control and collaboration
