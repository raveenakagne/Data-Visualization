Dataset:
The "ElectricElectric Charging Station Usage (July 2011 - Dec 2020)" dataset was chosen for analysis.
Timeframe:
Data is collected from the period of July 2011 to December 2020.

Dataset Description:
Our dataset provides a comprehensive overview of interactions between electric vehicle users and charging stations. Sourced from the City of Palo Alto, the dataset encompasses transactions spanning July 2011 and captures essential metrics that underpin our project's objective.
Central to our analysis, the dataset comprises 27 distinct features. The most crucial among them include:
Start Date and End Date: shed light on peak usage times and potential seasonal or daily charging trends.
Total Duration: reflecting the average charging duration and offering insights into user charging habits and station efficiency.
Energy (kWh): a measure of energy consumption for each charging session, indicative of charge requirements and equipment efficiency.
GHG Savings (kg) and Gasoline Savings (gallons): Quantifying environmental benefits is a key parameter for assessing the ecological impact of EVs.
Port Type and Plug Type: Elucidating user preferences and indicating any potential technological or compatibility gaps in the charging process
EVSE ID and Address: Instrumental in spatially mapping the existing charging infrastructure and detecting high traffic zones or network gaps.
Fee: A financial metric that, when analyzed, can influence pricing strategies and gauge user's spending behaviors.
Ended By: Signifying the end-cause of a charging session, it provides a deep dive into user behaviors and station functionality.
User ID: Facilitating user segmentation is a cornerstone for differentiating between habitual and sporadic users.
